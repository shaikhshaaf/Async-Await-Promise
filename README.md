# Async-Await-Promise
simple example of promise and async 
A promise is an object which can be returned synchronously from an asynchronous function. It will be in one of 3 possible states:
Fulfilled: onFulfilled() will be called (e.g., resolve() was called)
Rejected: onRejected() will be called (e.g., reject() was called)
Pending: not yet fulfilled or rejected
